Rocket Laucher

The rocket launcher is used to fire rockets, missiles that fly in a straight line and explode when they hit anything solid. When picked up, the launcher contains two rockets (four at the I'm Too Young To Die and Nightmare! skill levels). 

The Doom 3 Rocket Launcher is based on the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle, as the Classic Doom rocket launcher has more of a late RPG design to it.
