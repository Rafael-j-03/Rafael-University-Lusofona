Pistol

The pistol is the player's default weapon, and fires bullets. Each player enters the game with a pistol, fifty bullets, and their fists, with the pistol selected as the active weapon. It uses the same ammunition as the chaingun. 

None of the monsters carry a pistol, though the Zombieman appears to be armed with a rifle that fires pistol bullets.
