BFG9000

The BFG9000 appears as a bulky steel-grey gun which fires large balls of green plasma (40 cells per blast). For general purposes it can be considered the most powerful weapon in the game.

The initials composing the weapon's name stand for "Big F***ing Gun." It officially stands for "Bio Force Gun" in the 2005 movie. In various materials the name has been bowdlerized as "Big Friggin' Gun" or "Big Fancy Gun."
